[ORDERS]
1.	(S) TACTICAL SITUATION:
MILITARY COMMAND IS PREPARING FOR AN ASSAULT ON THE UNDERDEFENDED AREA OF <color=#E6B621><ENDLOCATION></color>. NATO HAS CAUGHT WIND OF THIS AND IS PLANNING ON REINFORCING THAT AREA, AND TO THAT END A LARGE SUPPLY CONVOY IS PREPARING TO DEPART FROM <color=#CBCB2B><STARTLOCATION_RO></color>. THE SUCCESSFUL DELIVERY OF THESE TROOPS AND SUPPLIES WILL INCREASE THE DEFENSE CAPIBILITY OF THE AREA BEYOND WHAT THE ASSAULT IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO DEFEAT. THERFORE, IT IS NECESSARY TO DISRUPT AND DESTROY THE CONVOY BEFORE IT LANDS THERE. NOTE THAT THE CONVOY WILL BE HEAVILY GUARDED, AND THAT WE CANNOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBLITY OF A SUBSURFACE ESCORT AS WELL.

2.	(S) PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
LOCATE THE CONVOY AND SINK THE TRANSPORT SHIPS.

3.	(S) SECODNDARY OBJECTIVE:
LOCATE AND SINK ANY ESCORTING WARSHIPS IF POSSIBLE.

4.	(S) AVOID DETECTION BY ENEMY ASW PATROLS

5.	(S) ROE: WARNING YELLOW, WEAPONS FREE ON DESIGNATED TARGETS

6.	(S) EMCON - MAINTAIN RADIO SILENCE UNTIL OTHERWISE DIRECTED

[MISSION WIN]
Great job, Captain! Keeping those supplies from the enemy will hopefully ensure the success of the attack. Your name will certainly make it to the commander's hand.
[MISSION FAIL]

[MISSION MISSED]
