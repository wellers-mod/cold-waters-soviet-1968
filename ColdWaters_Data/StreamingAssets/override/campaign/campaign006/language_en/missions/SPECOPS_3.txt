[MISSION WIN]
Good job. More enemy communications indicate you sank the boat carrying the team.
[MISSION FAIL]
You failed to prevent them from deploying the team. Command is heavily disappointed in you.
[MISSION MISSED]
Further search deemed unproductive. While we do not yet know the results of the raid, due in part to its success, command is heavily disappointed in your failure.
