Title=<b>THE COLLAPSE OF NATO</b>
Sentence1=Despite the resistance of NATO member countries, Warsaw Pact troops today managed to capture all strategically important regions in Germany and Western Europe. While Soviet troops have stopped on the French border, this likely is only because the French government possess nuclear weapons, and not because the Soviet war machine has run out of steam.
Sentence2=NATO's inability to fulfill its promises to protect its member countries has led to an avalanche-like collapse of the bloc, and most NATO countries have begun individual negotiations with the USSR on peace. Notably, under the watchful gaze of the Politburo, West Germany has begun unification talks with the GDR.
