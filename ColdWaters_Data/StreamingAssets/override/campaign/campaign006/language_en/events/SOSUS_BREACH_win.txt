Sentence1=According to our correspondent from Norway, last night Annea was attacked by a Soviet sabotage group. At first, the special forces carried out a diversionary maneuver: an attack on a local airbase, and while most of the security forces were engaged in combat, another part of the group completely destroyed the SOSUS station.

Sentence2=As a result of a brutal battle, the Norwegian side lost about 50 people killed and wounded, the runway of the airbase was seriously damaged and fires at fuel depots have not yet been extinguished. The SOSUS border between Norway and Svalbard is not functioning, the SOSUS station is completely destroyed and it will take months to restore. The losses of the Soviet side are not exactly known: the bodies of four commandos were found at the airbase, but the rest of the group disappeared without a trace.
